This is a large star forming region like the Orion Nebula. The dark hollow areas embedded
in the blue regions are cavities that were carved out by radiation and winds from the region&amp;rsquo;s
massive stars.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Veil Nebula</title><link>http://chang48.github.io/post/2022/11-04-veil/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Nov 2022 22:06:54 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://chang48.github.io/post/2022/11-04-veil/</guid><description>&lt;p>The Veil Nebula. This is a 2x3 Mosaic narrow-band imaging project that took me almost two months (9/4/2022 ~ 11/1/2022)
to complete. A total of 2155 subs with 179 hours of accumulated exposure time. This nebula is a magnificent supernova
remnant in the area of Cygnus, one of my favorite constellations.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Squid Nebula</title><link>http://chang48.github.io/post/2022/07-04-squid/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Jul 2022 15:16:54 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://chang48.github.io/post/2022/07-04-squid/</guid><description>&lt;p>SH2-129 Flying Bat (red) and OU-4 Squid Nebulae. The combo can be found in the constellation Cepheus.
Both are in the family of emission nebula. The Flying Bat consists of mostly ionized hydrogen gas while
the Squid is a region full of ionized oxygen clouds. Due to its extremely dimness, the Squid was
discovered only recently in 2011 by French astrophotographer Nicolas Outters. The formation of
the Squid is still under debate. But many astronomers believe the bright star HD202214 (near the center
of the photo) plays a major role.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>M13 Cluster</title><link>http://chang48.github.io/post/2022/06-05-m13/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Jun 2022 12:39:44 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://chang48.github.io/post/2022/06-05-m13/</guid><description>&lt;p>M13, the Great Globular Cluster. Located in the constellation of Hercules., it is roughly 27,100 light
years away from Earth. The cluster is the brightest globular cluster in the northern hemisphere, visible
to the naked eye under dark skies. My first astrophotography image taken with the Takahashi FSQ-85EDX,
also called the &lt;strong>Baby-Q&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>IC1396 Elephan's Trunk Nebula</title><link>http://chang48.github.io/post/2022/05-30-elephans-trunk/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 May 2022 23:33:40 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://chang48.github.io/post/2022/05-30-elephans-trunk/</guid><description>&lt;p>Elephant&amp;rsquo;s Trunk and the IC1396. Standard SHO narrow band image. Elephant&amp;rsquo;s trunk (the dark cloud in the left) is an area of interstellar gas and dust in the large ionized gas region IC1396. The area is located in the constellation Cepheus, about 2400 light years away from Earth.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The entire area is very dynamic. The IC1396 is being illuminated and ionized by a bright and massive star HD 206267 seen near the center of the frame. The Elephant&amp;rsquo;s Trunk region is currently thought to be a star formation site containing many young stars (less than 100,000 years old).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Study notes: MLops Week 4</title><link>http://chang48.github.io/post/2022/mlops-week4/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 Apr 2022 14:43:32 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://chang48.github.io/post/2022/mlops-week4/</guid><description>&lt;p>Quick notes of AWS MLops, Week 4&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Study notes: MLops Week 3-3 Computer Vision</title><link>http://chang48.github.io/post/2022/mlops-week33-computer-vision/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Apr 2022 15:44:25 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://chang48.github.io/post/2022/mlops-week33-computer-vision/</guid><description>&lt;p>Week 3-3 of the AWS MLops: Computer vision and AWS Rekognition&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Study notes: MLops Week 3-2 Forecasting</title><link>http://chang48.github.io/post/2022/mlops-week32-forecasting/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Mar 2022 13:48:38 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://chang48.github.io/post/2022/mlops-week32-forecasting/</guid><description>&lt;p>Week 3-2 of the AWS MLops: AWS Forecast and time-series data&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Study notes: MLops Week 3-1 Machine Learning pipeline</title><link>http://chang48.github.io/post/2022/mlops-week31-model-selection/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Mar 2022 14:33:07 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://chang48.github.io/post/2022/mlops-week31-model-selection/</guid><description>&lt;p>Week 3-1 of the AWS MLops: ML steps, pipeline, and AWS SageMaker&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Study notes: MLops Week 2 AWS ML Data Preparation</title><link>http://chang48.github.io/post/2022/mlops-week2-aws-ml-data-preparation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Mar 2022 11:21:25 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://chang48.github.io/post/2022/mlops-week2-aws-ml-data-preparation/</guid><description>&lt;p>Week 2 of the AWS MLops: Data preparation using AWS services&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Study notes: MLops Week 1-3 Data Ingestion and Transformation</title><link>http://chang48.github.io/post/2022/mlops-week13-data-ingestion/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Mar 2022 15:05:02 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://chang48.github.io/post/2022/mlops-week13-data-ingestion/</guid><description>&lt;p>Week 1-3 of the AWS MLops: Data ingestion and AWS jobs&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>NGC2175, Monkey Head Nebula</title><link>http://chang48.github.io/post/2022/03-04-monkey/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Mar 2022 19:45:50 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://chang48.github.io/post/2022/03-04-monkey/</guid><description>&lt;p>SH2-252 Monkey Head Nebula. Located in the Orion Constellation. Embedded in the nebula is an open
cluster NGC 2175. The cluster is about 6350 light years from Earth. The nebula has active ionized oxygen,
sulfur, and hydrogen clouds. A very good narrowband subject. Does the nebula look like a monkey head?
I can&amp;rsquo;t really tell&amp;hellip;ðŸ˜‚&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Horsehead Nebula</title><link>http://chang48.github.io/post/2022/02-28-horsehead/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Feb 2022 00:16:54 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://chang48.github.io/post/2022/02-28-horsehead/</guid><description>&lt;p>IC434 Horsehead Nebula. This nebula is probably one of the most imaged subject in astrophotography.
IC434 is a dark nebula in the constellation Orion. It is about 1375 light years away from Earth.
The nebula got its name because the dark dust cloud looks just like a horse&amp;rsquo;s head. Behind the
Horsehead nebula is a huge area of ionized hydrogen gas lit up by the star group Sigma Orions
(at the top of the image)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Study notes: MLops Week 1-2 Data Repositories</title><link>http://chang48.github.io/post/2022/mlops-week12-data-repositories/</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Feb 2022 15:05:02 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://chang48.github.io/post/2022/mlops-week12-data-repositories/</guid><description>&lt;p>Week 1-2 of the AWS MLops: Data repositories and AWS managed storage choices&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Study notes: MLops Week 1-1 AWS Machine Learning Technologies</title><link>http://chang48.github.io/post/2022/mlops-week11-aws-ml-technologies/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Feb 2022 17:55:25 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://chang48.github.io/post/2022/mlops-week11-aws-ml-technologies/</guid><description>&lt;p>Week 1-1 of the AWS MLops: Introduction&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Normal distributions and $\pi$</title><link>http://chang48.github.io/post/2021/gaussial-integral/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Dec 2021 00:46:08 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://chang48.github.io/post/2021/gaussial-integral/</guid><description>&lt;p>Normal distributions are a class of continuous probability distribution for random variables.
They often show up in measurements of physical quantities. For example,
&lt;a href="https://ourworldindata.org/human-height#height-is-normally-distributed" target="_blank">
the human height is normally distributed&lt;/a>. In fact, it is claimed that variables in natural
and social sciences are normally or approximately normally distributed. Weight, reading
ability, test scores, blood pressure, $\ldots$&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Orion Nebula</title><link>http://chang48.github.io/post/2021/11-05-orion/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Nov 2021 12:30:04 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://chang48.github.io/post/2021/11-05-orion/</guid><description>&lt;p>Revisited the Orion Nebula M42. This time with the mighty (comparing to to WO Z61 MK2) Takahashi TSA-120N.
M42 is a very bright nebula so it is fairly straightforward to image overall. The most tricky part is probably
the Trapezium region where care must be taken in order to prevent overexposure. I managed to get a few hours
of LRGB data before the clouds kicked in. Applied a PixInsight HDR trick I learned from the internet to
process the Trapezium cluster region.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
