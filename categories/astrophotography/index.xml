This is a large star forming region like the Orion Nebula. The dark hollow areas embedded
in the blue regions are cavities that were carved out by radiation and winds from the region&amp;rsquo;s
massive stars.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Squid Nebula</title><link>http://chang48.github.io/post/2022/07-04-squid/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Jul 2022 15:16:54 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://chang48.github.io/post/2022/07-04-squid/</guid><description>&lt;p>SH2-129 Flying Bat (red) and OU-4 Squid Nebulae. The combo can be found in the constellation Cepheus.
Both are in the family of emission nebula. The Flying Bat consists of mostly ionized hydrogen gas while
the Squid is a region full of ionized oxygen clouds. Due to its extremely dimness, the Squid was
discovered only recently in 2011 by French astrophotographer Nicolas Outters. The formation of
the Squid is still under debate. But many astronomers believe the bright star HD202214 at the center
of the frame plays a major role.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Horsehead Nebula</title><link>http://chang48.github.io/post/2022/02-28-horsehead/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Feb 2022 00:16:54 -0700</pubDate><guid>http://chang48.github.io/post/2022/02-28-horsehead/</guid><description>&lt;p>IC434 Horsehead Nebula. This nebula is probably one of the most imaged subject in astrophotography.
IC434 is a dark nebula in the constellation Orion. It is about 1375 light years away from Earth.
The nebula got its name because the dark dust cloud looks just like a horse&amp;rsquo;s head. Behind the
Horsehead nebula is a huge area of ionized hydrogen gas lit up by the star group Sigma Orions
(at the top of the image)&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
